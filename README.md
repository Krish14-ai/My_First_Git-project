# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

## 📌 About This Repository

This repository is a learning-focused collection that reflects my understanding of **Data Structures** built over the past few months. It is not a traditional project or application. Instead, it is a structured knowledge base that explains different data structures, how they work, where they are used, and why they matter.

The goal is simple:

* To document what I have learned
* To revise concepts quickly
* To help beginners understand DSA in a clean and practical way

## 🧠 What is Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)?

**Data Structures** are ways of organizing and storing data so it can be accessed and modified efficiently.

**Algorithms** are step-by-step procedures or logic used to solve a problem using those data structures.

In short:

> Data Structures decide **how data is stored**, and Algorithms decide **how data is processed**.

Efficient DSA helps in:

* Faster execution
* Better memory usage
* Scalable software
* Writing optimized and clean code

## 🗂️ Types of Data Structures

Data structures are broadly divided into two categories:

### 1️⃣ Linear Data Structures

Data elements are stored sequentially.

#### 🔹 Array

* Stores elements in contiguous memory locations
* Fixed size (in most languages)

**Use cases:**

* Storing lists of items
* Index-based access
* Matrix representation

**Examples:**

* Student marks list
* Image pixels

---

#### 🔹 Linked List

* It is a Non-Linear Data structure instead it has a Node and a Pointer(->) connected with next element
* Elements (nodes) are connected using pointers
* Dynamic size

**Types:**

* Singly Linked List
* Doubly Linked List
* Circular Linked List

**Use cases:**

* Dynamic memory allocation
* Implementation of stacks and queues
* Music playlist navigation

---

#### 🔹 Stack (LIFO)

Last In, First Out structure

**Operations:**

* Push
* Pop
* Peek

**Use cases:**

* Function calls (call stack)
* Undo/Redo operations
* Expression evaluation

---

#### 🔹 Queue (FIFO)

First In, First Out structure

**Types:**

* Simple Queue
* Circular Queue
* Priority Queue
* Deque

**Use cases:**

* CPU scheduling
* Printer queue
* Task scheduling

---

### 2️⃣ Non-Linear Data Structures

Data elements are stored hierarchically or graph-based.

#### 🔹 Tree

* Hierarchical data structure
* Has root, parent, and child nodes

**Types:**

* Binary Tree
* Binary Search Tree (BST)
* AVL Tree
* Heap

**Use cases:**

* File systems
* Database indexing
* Expression trees

---

#### 🔹 Graph

* Consists of vertices (nodes) and edges
* Can be directed or undirected

**Use cases:**

* Social networks
* Maps and navigation
* Network routing

---

#### 🔹 Hash Table

* Stores data in key-value pairs
* Uses hashing for fast access

**Use cases:**

* Database indexing
* Caching
* Password storage

## ⚙️ Why DSA is Important?

Learning DSA helps you:

* Write efficient and optimized code
* Crack coding interviews
* Understand system design better
* Improve problem-solving skills

Almost every tech company tests DSA because it shows how well you think, not just how much syntax you know.

---

## 🎯 Who Is This Repository For?

* Beginners learning DSA
* Students preparing for exams or interviews
* Anyone who wants clean explanations with practical use cases

---

## 🚀 Future Plans

* Add algorithm explanations
* Include time and space complexity analysis
* Add code implementations in Java/Python
* Add practice problems

---

## 📌 Note

This repository represents my personal learning journey. It may evolve as I learn more advanced concepts.

If you are learning DSA too, feel free to explore and learn along.
