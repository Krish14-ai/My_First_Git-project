STACK DATA STRUCTURE
====================
** OVERVIEW **

A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO principle
(Last In, First Out).

The last element inserted into the stack is the first one to be removed.

* Example analogy:
A stack of plates. You add plates on the top and remove plates from the top only.

** KEY CHARACTERISTICS **

# Access is restricted to one end only (called TOP)
# No random access to elements
# Simple and efficient
# Frequently used in system-level operations
