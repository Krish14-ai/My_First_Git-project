STACK DATA STRUCTURE
====================
** OVERVIEW **

A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO principle
(Last In, First Out).

The last element inserted into the stack is the first one to be removed.

* Example analogy:
A stack of plates. You add plates on the top and remove plates from the top only.

** KEY CHARACTERISTICS **

# Access is restricted to one end only (called TOP)
# No random access to elements
# Simple and efficient
# Frequently used in system-level operations

Basic Operations
Operation	Description
Push	Insert an element at the top
Pop	Remove the top element
Peek / Top	View the top element without removing it
isEmpty	Check if the stack is empty
isFull	Check if the stack is full (array-based stack)


**STACK ERRORS**

*Stack Overflow
Occurs when trying to push an element into a full stack

*Stack Underflow

Implementation Approaches
1. Array-Based Stack

Fixed size

Faster access

Memory efficient

Risk of overflow

2. Linked List-Based Stack

Dynamic size

No overflow (until memory runs out)

Slightly higher memory usage
Occurs when trying to pop an element from an empty stack
