ARRAYS – INTRODUCTION (DATA STRUCTURES)

What is an Array?
An array is a data structure used to store multiple values of the same data type under one variable name.
Instead of creating many variables, we store all related values together.

Example:
marks = [70, 85, 90, 60]

How Arrays are Stored in Memory
Arrays store elements in continuous (adjacent) memory locations.
This allows fast access to any element using its index.

Memory representation:
| 70 | 85 | 90 | 60 |

Indexing
Each element in an array has a position called an index.
Indexing usually starts from 0.

marks = [70, 85, 90, 60]
index     0   1   2   3

marks[0] gives 70
marks[2] gives 90

Why Arrays are Fast
Arrays allow direct access to elements using index.
The computer calculates the memory address directly.
This is called constant time access (O(1)).

Array Declaration Examples

Python:
arr = [10, 20, 30, 40]

Java:
int[] arr = {10, 20, 30, 40};

C:
int arr[4] = {10, 20, 30, 40};

Traversing an Array
Traversing means visiting each element of the array.

Python example:
for i in range(len(arr)):
    print(arr[i])

Types of Arrays

1. One-Dimensional Array
A simple list of elements.
Example:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Used for storing marks, prices, scores, etc.

2. Two-Dimensional Array
An array of arrays.
Example:
[
  [1, 2],
  [3, 4]
]

Used for matrices, tables, grids, and images.

Advantages of Arrays
- Fast access to elements
- Simple and easy to use
- Efficient memory usage

Limitations of Arrays
- Fixed size
- Insertion and deletion are slow
- Stores only same data type

When to Use Arrays
Use arrays when:
- The size of data is known
- Fast access is required
- Data type is same

Avoid arrays when:
- Data size changes frequently
- Many insert or delete operations are needed

Important Exam Points
- Index-based questions
- Loop tracing on arrays
- Finding maximum, minimum, sum
- Basic 2D array problems

Key Sentence to Remember
An array stores elements of the same data type in continuous memory locations and allows fast access using index.

Note :-
 A word of advice if you can't understand the given information is to imagine array as the bogeys of a train and elements as the passengers,
 As the passengers have their "own seat numbers" and "bogey numbers" assigned to them so as the elements.
 Elements too have their own "indices" and their own "addresses" in memory where they are stored in the memory.
 This visualization of passengers in a bogey of a train will make things easier to understand.
