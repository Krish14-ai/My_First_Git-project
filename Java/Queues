QUEUE DATA STRUCTURE
===================

Purpose : Explain the Queue data structure in a clear, structured,
          and practical manner for learning and revision.

------------------------------------------------------------

OVERVIEW
--------
A Queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO principle
(First In, First Out).

The element inserted first is the first one to be removed.

A real-world analogy is a line at a ticket counter.
